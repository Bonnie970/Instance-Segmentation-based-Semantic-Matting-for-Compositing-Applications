We observe some issues in testing images: some solid boundaries tend to be fuzzy and some solid materials tend to be transparent. This could be due to the matting model overfitting on fuzzy and transparent objects. It would be nice if we can train the matting model with more solid boundary objects. Feel free leave a comment if you find better solutions :)
